    <h1>Fettuccine Alfredo</h1>
    <h2>This simple pasta was created around 1909</h2>

    <IMG SRC="siteimages/alfredo.png" alt="No cream here. Can you get guess the two ingredients from this poorly drawn illustration?">


        <P>For an authentic experience, the pasta should be stirred with oversized, golden utensils.</P>

            <P>Alfredo Dilelio invented the original dish in his home kitchen while nursing his wife back to health. He took a traditional
                recipe of pasta al burro -- pasta sauced with butter and cheese -- and made it more extravagant but tripling down on the butter and adding far more cheese. He added it to his restaurant menu shortly after at the urging of his wife. </P>

<P>Delelio was a true showman. He prepared the dish tableside accompanied by live string instruments. Eventually he was given
    a gold spoon and fork by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, who ate at Delelio's restaurant on their honeymoon, and who helped introduce the dish to America.

</P>

<P>Many variations on this have evolved over the years, and generally in America this evolution has meant increasing the fat content, adding cream, and more cheeses. Howvever, purity of the original can't be beat.

        <h1>Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</h1>
        <P>If you love Italian-American food, you'll love <em><A HREF="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538162354">Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</A></em>.
     There is an entire chapter on the origin of Alfredo sauce. 

        <P>The book traces the evolution of traditional Italian-American cuisine, often referred to as “red sauce Italian,” from its origins in Italy to its transformation in America into a new, distinct cuisine. It is a fascinating social and culinary history exploring the integration of red sauce food into mainstream America alongside the blending of Italian immigrant otherness into a national American identity. The story follows the small parlor restaurants immigrants launched from their homes to large, popular destinations, and eventually to commodified fast food and casual dining restaurants. Some dishes like fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti alla Caruso owe their success to celebrities, and Italian-American cuisine generally has benefitted from a rich history in popular culture. </P>
