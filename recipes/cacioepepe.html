<h1>History Repeats</h1>
<P>Cacio e pepe is one of the oldest preperations for pasta. Cheese and pepper were available long before tomatoes arrived 
in Italy. Even Roman soldiers likely ate some variation of this dish. For years though the dish remained relatively unknown, only 
to find fame in the 2000s, revived by celebrity chef Mario Batali and a few others.</P>

<h1>Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</h1>
<P>If you love Italian-American food, you'll love <em><A HREF="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538162354">Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</A></em>.
<em>Red Sauce</em> explores the history of Italians in America and their food as it evolved in their new country. 

<P>The book traces the evolution of traditional Italian-American cuisine, often referred to as “red sauce Italian,” from its origins in Italy to its transformation in America into a new, distinct cuisine. It is a fascinating social and culinary history exploring the integration of red sauce food into mainstream America alongside the blending of Italian immigrant otherness into a national American identity. The story follows the small parlor restaurants immigrants launched from their homes to large, popular destinations, and eventually to commodified fast food and casual dining restaurants. Some dishes like fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti alla Caruso owe their success to celebrities, and Italian-American cuisine generally has benefitted from a rich history in popular culture. </P>
