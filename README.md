This is the first actual project for The Odin Project that I am making

Since I largely know how to code HTML and CSS, the main challenge is familiarizing myself with GIT and Terminal, and of course GitHub. 

I'm also hoping to stylize the project as a brutalist design. 

And since I have a lot of my own recipes, maybe I will change these around, or do something to support the publicaiton of Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American
