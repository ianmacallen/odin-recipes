    <h1>Red Sauce: That's Amore</h1>

<h2>Italian-American immigrants invented "red sauce" cuisine in America
</h2>

<P>Pizza might be common around the globe, and spaghetti and meatballs a common all-American dinner today, but that wasn't always the case. During the 
    period of mass Italian migration, millions of immigrants arrived in the United States and invented a whole new cuisine. They departed Italy poor, but in the United States, felt rich, and 
    cooked rich, meat-filled dishes based on how they imagined rich Italians ate. The trouble was, very few of these immigrants had ever eaten like a rich person before.

</P>

<P>The red sauce that we associate with Italian Americans or that is feature prominently in films like <em>Goodfellas</em> or shows like <em>The Sopranos</em> are what we think of as "red sauce."  </P>

<P>These foods continued to evolve as red sauce became more popular and mainstream, and many of authentic "Italian" foods at chain restaurants or sold from national brands liek chef Boyardee further changed 
    this cuisine. </P>

<P>This site is intentionally stylized and meant to be entertaining rather than beautiful or useful. For intsance, the above image of 
    Hunt's ten-minute pizza is not especially appetizing. The image comes from an advertising campaign intended to attract new consumers 
    for Hunt's tomato products -- and thus was born the English muffin pizza. The use of ten-minute pizza indicates how Italian-Americna food become more popular in the post-war period,
    but we wouldn't recommend this recipe.

    <h1>Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</h1>
    <P>If you love Italian-American food, you'll love <em><A HREF="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538162354">Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American</A></em>.
  <em>Red Sauce</em> explores the history of Italians in America and their food as it evolved in their new country. 

    <P>The book traces the evolution of traditional Italian-American cuisine, often referred to as “red sauce Italian,” from its origins in Italy to its transformation in America into a new, distinct cuisine. It is a fascinating social and culinary history exploring the integration of red sauce food into mainstream America alongside the blending of Italian immigrant otherness into a national American identity. The story follows the small parlor restaurants immigrants launched from their homes to large, popular destinations, and eventually to commodified fast food and casual dining restaurants. Some dishes like fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti alla Caruso owe their success to celebrities, and Italian-American cuisine generally has benefitted from a rich history in popular culture. </P>
